**Sales Insights Dashboard**

This project aims to provide actionable sales insights for a company through an interactive dashboard built with Power BI. By analyzing and visualizing the sales data, stakeholders can monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

üìä Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The sales data was cleaned and transformed using SQL Server to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Statistical and Mathematical Analysis: Conducted using Excel for calculations like averages, growth rates, and standard deviations.
Python for Data Analysis: Utilized Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Generating summary statistics.
Automating data transformation workflows.
Interactive Dashboard: Created in Power BI, the dashboard offers:
Comprehensive sales summaries.
Performance metrics by product, region, and time period.
Visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and KPIs.
Data-Driven Insights: Enables stakeholders to monitor sales trends, evaluate performance, and identify areas of improvement.
‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
SQL Server: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
Excel: For statistical and mathematical calculations.
Python: For data analysis and automation.
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
